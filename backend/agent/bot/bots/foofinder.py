        Big one here... doesn't need to check Moves that lead to board_to_play is None 
        Make it only simulate moves that don't lead to board_to_play=None, for both players 
        So the moves that win a local board, even if they let board_to_play=None, will be used 
        
        The way to do this is to use the winnables board hash to check which moves not to expand
        So if a move leads to board_to_play = None, then check if that move is in the winnable boards hash
        This check is done by doing:
            if (loc_row, loc_col) in self.get_winnableMoves(local_board) -> bool

        If that's False, it's not worth expanding, just break the cycle, continue to the next move without
        calling the function recursively, to avoid checking moves that lead to btp=None which will advantage the rival.
        This only works at this early stage
